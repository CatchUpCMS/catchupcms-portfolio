For the past years my website was a wordpress powered website, saying I'm a webdesigner & Wordpress develoepr. My interests have changed since then, so I figured it was time for a change!

I've build this website using Laravel 4.3. It has also a 'flat-file' based blog, every blog-post is a [markdown file](https://github.com/nWidart/portfolio/tree/master/data/posts). There're no database calls on this website. The source-code can be found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/nWidart/portfolio). Nothing spectacular but it works. :)

I haven't used the custom theme I made for the previous Wordpress portfolio, because I wanted to have a fresh start.
